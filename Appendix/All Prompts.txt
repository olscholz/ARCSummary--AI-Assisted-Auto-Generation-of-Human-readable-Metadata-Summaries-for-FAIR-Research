Plants have evolved a range of mechanisms to cope with drought, including a specialized type of photosynthesis termed Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM). CAM is associated with stomatal closure during the day as atmospheric CO2 is assimilated primarily during the night, thus reducing transpirational water loss. The tropical herbaceous perennial species Talinum triangulare is capable of transitioning, in a facultative, reversible manner, from C3 photosynthesis to weakly expressed CAM in response to drought stress. The transcriptional regulation of this transition has been studied. Combining mRNA-Seq with targeted metabolite measurements, we found highly elevated levels of CAM-cycle enzyme transcripts and their metabolic products in T. triangulare leaves upon water deprivation. The carbohydrate metabolism is rewired to reduce the use of reserves for growth to support the CAM-cycle and the synthesis of compatible solutes. This large-scale expression dataset of drought-induced CAM demonstrates transcriptional regulation of the C3ÐCAM transition. We identified candidate transcription factors to mediate this photosynthetic plasticity, which may contribute in the future to the design of more drought-tolerant crops via engineered CAM.<<Test ARC registry>>### Top-Level-Metadata:  | Meta Data | Description || --------- | ----------- || Submission Date | July 07, 2015 || Public Release Date | Nov 05, 2015 || Study identifiers | TalinumGenomeDraft , TalinumSamples-STRI || Study Count | 2 || Assay identifiers | MassHunter_targets , RNASeq , GCqTOF_targets || Assay Count | 3 |### Additional Details TalinumGenomeDraft  | Meta Data | Description || --------- | ----------- || Table Count | 1 || Table Names | TalinumGenomeDraft || Sample Count | 1 || Data File Count | 1 || Biological replicates | 0 | ## Study_TalinumSamples-STRI_plant_materialCharacteristics: (organism: Talinum fruticosum ;

Plants were subjected to two watering regimes: 12 days of drought stress and 12 days of drought followed by 2 days of rewatering. Leaf samples were collected at mid-day (ZT6) for transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses. Total RNA was extracted using a standardized commercial protocol and sequenced using Illumina HiSeq platforms with TruSeq RNA library preparation. Metabolites were extracted from dry tissue using water-based buffers, derivatized via methoxyamination and trimethylsilylation, and analyzed through gas chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-QTOF-MS).

By leveraging integrative mRNA sequencing and targeted metabolomics, the study aims to identify key regulatory elements and metabolic shifts that enable photosynthetic plasticity and drought tolerance, with implications for engineering CAM traits into crops.The experimental design compares leaf tissues of 28-day-old *T. fruticosum* plants subjected to three photosynthetic modes (C3, CAM, and reC3) under two primary drought treatment conditions: 12 days of drought and 12 days of drought followed by 2 days of rewatering. Sampling was standardized to mid-day (MD, ZT=6) under controlled environmental conditions. RNA was extracted from leaf tissues using the Roboklon EURx GeneMATRIX system and sequenced via Illumina HiSeq 2000/2500 platforms to assess transcriptomic changes. Concurrently, targeted metabolite profiling was performed using GC-QTOF mass spectrometry following vacuum drying, methoxyamination, and TMS derivatization of leaf extracts. Data from RNASeq and metabolomics assays were mapped to associated studies and integrated to reveal coordinated shifts in CAM-cycle enzyme expression, carbohydrate metabolism, and solute synthesis. This multi-omic approach enabled the identification of candidate transcription factors mediating the C3ÐCAM switch and provided mechanistic insights into the plantÕs drought-responsive metabolic reprogramming.Balancing NutrientsHybrid Prompt### Investigation Description:  Efficient nutrient mobilization from seed storage tissues is essential for seedling establishment, particularly in legumes such as Lupinus albus (white lupin), which thrive in nutrient-poor soils. This study investigates the role of cotyledons in nitrogen (N) and mineral remobilization after germination during their transition from storage organs to photosynthetically active tissues including the metabolic challenges posed by coexistence of these two functions in epigeal germination. We cultivated white lupin seedlings under nitrogen-deficient conditions, analyzing cotyledon composition and function over 28 days. Our results indicate that 60 % of cotyledon-stored proteins are degraded within the first eight days, with free amino acids transiently accumulating before being redistributed to support growth. The progressive depletion of cotyledon reserves was accompanied by structural and metabolic changes, including an increase in photosynthetic proteins. However, cotyledon photosynthetic capacity remained lower than that of true leaves, suggesting a transient role in energy metabolism. The loss of cotyledons before day 12 significantly impaired seedling development, emphasizing their critical contribution to nitrogen, phosphate, and micronutrient supply during early growth. Comparative proteomic analysis revealed dynamic shifts in nutrient transport, amino acid metabolism, and stress response pathways following cotyledon removal. These findings underscore the significance of cotyledon nutrient remobilization in legume adaptation to low-fertility soils and highlight potential targets for breeding strategies aimed at improving nutrient use efficiency. By optimizing cotyledon nutrient composition and function, future breeding efforts could enhance seedling vigor, reduce fertilizer dependency, and improve the nutritional value of lupin-based foods. ### Top-Level-Metadata:  | Meta Data | Description || --------- | ----------- || Submission Date | 2025-04-18T15:30 || Study identifiers | LupinusAlbusCotyledon , LupinusAlbusPlantsAtDay28 , CotyledonVsLeaf , PlantMaterialElementalAnalysis || Study Count | 4 || Assay identifiers | QuantitativeShotgunProteomics , ProteinQuantification , PhotosynthesisRespirationMeasurements , LipidQuantification , PhosphateQuantification , ChlorophyllQuantification , PulseAmplitudeModulationFluorometry , CarbohydrateQuantification , ElementalAnalysis , CarbonAndNitrogenQuantification , FreeAminoAcidQuantification || Assay Count | 11 | ## Study_LupinusAlbusCotyledon_CotyledonSamplesCharacteristics: (Organism: Lupinus albus ; ecotype: Nelly ; Tissue: Cotyledon ; substrate: Expanded clay substrate (LamstedtDan, 4 - 8 mm, Fibo ExClay Deutschland GmbH, Lamstedt, Germany) ; Supplier: Revierberatung Wolmersdorf GmbH & Co.

Nelly) seedlings, focusing on their function in nutrient remobilization and their temporary transition to photosynthetically active tissues during early development under nitrogen-deficient conditions. The study primarily examined how the timing of cotyledon removal affects seedling vigor, nutrient availability, and metabolic activity, with the broader goal of identifying potential targets for breeding strategies to improve nutrient use efficiency in legumes grown on nutrient-poor soils.To achieve this, white lupin seeds were pre-soaked and cultivated on water-saturated expanded clay substrate under controlled phytochamber conditions (22Ð24?¡C, 110?µmol photons?s???m??, 16?h photoperiod). Cotyledons were harvested at multiple time points (days 0Ð28), while some plants underwent surgical cotyledon removal at days 8, 12, 16, or 20, and were monitored until day 28. The experimental design incorporated comparative analyses between plants with and without cotyledons, as well as between cotyledons and true leaves (harvested at day 12), to assess differences in metabolic capacity and nutrient content. A suite of integrated assays was employed to quantify proteomic changes, carbon and nitrogen content, elemental and phosphate composition, free amino acid levels, and photosynthetic performance. Proteomic profiling using quantitative shotgun proteomics and functional assays such as PAM fluorometry and respiration measurements revealed progressive protein degradation and nutrient redistribution in cotyledons, alongside limited but detectable photosynthetic capacity. Collectively, these data demonstrated that cotyledons are essential for early nitrogen, phosphate, and micronutrient supply, and their premature loss significantly impairs seedling development, supporting their critical role in legume adaptation to low-fertility environments.Enhanced PromptSummarize the biological and experimental objectives of the following Investigation based on the available metadata of its Studies and Assays.        You will receive identifiers, ontology annotations, and descriptive metadata for each component.        Extract relevant experimental factors and variables to construct a structured summary in two paragraphs:        - **Paragraph 1 (2-3 sentences):** Summarize the experimental objective of the Investigation        - **Paragraph 2 (5-7 sentences):** Describe the experimental design and methodology        Employ formal scientific language appropriate for an abstract and methods section.### Investigation Description:  Efficient nutrient mobilization from seed storage tissues is essential for seedling establishment, particularly in legumes such as Lupinus albus (white lupin), which thrive in nutrient-poor soils. This study investigates the role of cotyledons in nitrogen (N) and mineral remobilization after germination during their transition from storage organs to photosynthetically active tissues including the metabolic challenges posed by coexistence of these two functions in epigeal germination. We cultivated white lupin seedlings under nitrogen-deficient conditions, analyzing cotyledon composition and function over 28 days. Our results indicate that 60 % of cotyledon-stored proteins are degraded within the first eight days, with free amino acids transiently accumulating before being redistributed to support growth. The progressive depletion of cotyledon reserves was accompanied by structural and metabolic changes, including an increase in photosynthetic proteins. However, cotyledon photosynthetic capacity remained lower than that of true leaves, suggesting a transient role in energy metabolism. The loss of cotyledons before day 12 significantly impaired seedling development, emphasizing their critical contribution to nitrogen, phosphate, and micronutrient supply during early growth. Comparative proteomic analysis revealed dynamic shifts in nutrient transport, amino acid metabolism, and stress response pathways following cotyledon removal. These findings underscore the significance of cotyledon nutrient remobilization in legume adaptation to low-fertility soils and highlight potential targets for breeding strategies aimed at improving nutrient use efficiency. By optimizing cotyledon nutrient composition and function, future breeding efforts could enhance seedling vigor, reduce fertilizer dependency, and improve the nutritional value of lupin-based foods. ### Top-Level-Metadata:  | Meta Data | Description || --------- | ----------- || Submission Date | 2025-04-18T15:30 || Study identifiers | LupinusAlbusCotyledon , LupinusAlbusPlantsAtDay28 , CotyledonVsLeaf , PlantMaterialElementalAnalysis || Study Count | 4 || Assay identifiers | QuantitativeShotgunProteomics , ProteinQuantification , PhotosynthesisRespirationMeasurements , LipidQuantification , PhosphateQuantification , ChlorophyllQuantification , PulseAmplitudeModulationFluorometry , CarbohydrateQuantification , ElementalAnalysis , CarbonAndNitrogenQuantification , FreeAminoAcidQuantification || Assay Count | 11 | ## Study_LupinusAlbusCotyledon_CotyledonSamplesCharacteristics: (Organism: Lupinus albus ; ecotype: Nelly ; Tissue: Cotyledon ; substrate: Expanded clay substrate (LamstedtDan, 4 - 8 mm, Fibo ExClay Deutschland GmbH, Lamstedt, Germany) ; Supplier: Revierberatung Wolmersdorf GmbH & Co.

By characterizing the transition of cotyledons from storage tissues to photosynthetically active organs during early seedling development, the study sought to determine how cotyledon function influences plant growth, nutrient allocation, and adaptation to nutrient-poor environments.**Paragraph 2 (Experimental Design and Methodology):**White lupin seedlings were cultivated under controlled phytochamber conditions using a nutrient-poor expanded clay substrate, with cotyledons removed at defined developmental stages (days 8, 12, 16, 20, or retained until day 28). Across four interconnected studies, tissue samplesÑincluding cotyledons, leaves, shoots, and rootsÑwere subjected to a comprehensive suite of biochemical and physiological assays. These included quantitative shotgun proteomics via ion mobility mass spectrometry (timsTOF), photometric quantification of proteins, carbohydrates, lipids, and chlorophyll, as well as elemental analysis using ICP-MS. Photosynthetic performance was assessed using pulse-amplitude modulation fluorometry and oxygen electrode-based respiration measurements. Carbon/nitrogen and amino acid content were measured through C/N analysis and HPLC, respectively. Comparative analyses between cotyledons and true leaves, along with time-course sampling, enabled identification of metabolic transitions, nutrient redistribution, and the consequences of premature cotyledon removal. This multifactorial approach allowed detailed insights into nutrient flux, proteome dynamics, and photosynthetic capacity, revealing cotyledon-derived nutrient mobilization as critical for early seedling vigor.Basic PromptSummarize the biological and experimental objectives of the following Investigation based on the available metadata of its Studies and Assays.        You will receive identifiers, ontology annotations, and descriptive metadata for each component.        Extract relevant experimental factors and variables to construct a structured summary in two paragraphs:        - **Paragraph 1 (2-3 sentences):** Summarize the experimental objective of the Investigation        - **Paragraph 2 (5-7 sentences):** Describe the experimental design and methodology        Employ formal scientific language appropriate for an abstract and methods section.### Investigation Description:  Efficient nutrient mobilization from seed storage tissues is essential for seedling establishment, particularly in legumes such as Lupinus albus (white lupin), which thrive in nutrient-poor soils. This study investigates the role of cotyledons in nitrogen (N) and mineral remobilization after germination during their transition from storage organs to photosynthetically active tissues including the metabolic challenges posed by coexistence of these two functions in epigeal germination. We cultivated white lupin seedlings under nitrogen-deficient conditions, analyzing cotyledon composition and function over 28 days. Our results indicate that 60 % of cotyledon-stored proteins are degraded within the first eight days, with free amino acids transiently accumulating before being redistributed to support growth. The progressive depletion of cotyledon reserves was accompanied by structural and metabolic changes, including an increase in photosynthetic proteins. However, cotyledon photosynthetic capacity remained lower than that of true leaves, suggesting a transient role in energy metabolism. The loss of cotyledons before day 12 significantly impaired seedling development, emphasizing their critical contribution to nitrogen, phosphate, and micronutrient supply during early growth. Comparative proteomic analysis revealed dynamic shifts in nutrient transport, amino acid metabolism, and stress response pathways following cotyledon removal. These findings underscore the significance of cotyledon nutrient remobilization in legume adaptation to low-fertility soils and highlight potential targets for breeding strategies aimed at improving nutrient use efficiency. By optimizing cotyledon nutrient composition and function, future breeding efforts could enhance seedling vigor, reduce fertilizer dependency, and improve the nutritional value of lupin-based foods. ### Top-Level-Metadata:  | Meta Data | Description || --------- | ----------- || Submission Date | 2025-04-18T15:30 || Study identifiers | LupinusAlbusCotyledon , LupinusAlbusPlantsAtDay28 , CotyledonVsLeaf , PlantMaterialElementalAnalysis || Study Count | 4 || Assay identifiers | QuantitativeShotgunProteomics , ProteinQuantification , PhotosynthesisRespirationMeasurements , LipidQuantification , PhosphateQuantification , ChlorophyllQuantification , PulseAmplitudeModulationFluorometry , CarbohydrateQuantification , ElementalAnalysis , CarbonAndNitrogenQuantification , FreeAminoAcidQuantification || Assay Count | 11 | ## Study_LupinusAlbusCotyledon_CotyledonSamplesCharacteristics: (Organism: Lupinus albus ; ecotype: Nelly ; Tissue: Cotyledon ; substrate: Expanded clay substrate (LamstedtDan, 4 - 8 mm, Fibo ExClay Deutschland GmbH, Lamstedt, Germany) ; Supplier: Revierberatung Wolmersdorf GmbH & Co.

The study focused on the remobilization of stored nutrients and the functional transition of cotyledons from storage organs to photosynthetically active tissues during early seedling development, with the objective of understanding their contribution to nutrient supply, photosynthesis, and overall seedling vigor.To achieve this, white lupin cv. ÔNellyÕ seedlings were cultivated under controlled environmental conditions on nutrient-poor expanded clay substrate, with cotyledon tissues sampled across multiple timepoints from germination to 28 days post-sowing. Experimental treatments included staged cotyledon removal (days 8, 12, 16, 20) to assess developmental and metabolic consequences on the remaining plant tissues. The study employed a suite of analytical assays including quantitative shotgun proteomics, elemental analysis via ICP-MS, and high-resolution measurements of proteins, amino acids, carbohydrates, lipids, chlorophyll, and phosphate content. Comparative analyses between cotyledons and true leaves (harvested at day 12) involved both structural and functional characterization of photosynthetic capacity using PAM fluorometry and oxygen electrode-based respiration assays. Quantitative protein profiling using timsTOF mass spectrometry and peptide assays provided insights into metabolic shifts and nutrient transport dynamics following cotyledon depletion. The integration of physiological measurements and molecular data enabled the identification of critical temporal windows and pathways involved in nutrient remobilization, thereby highlighting the cotyledons' indispensable role in early growth and adaptation to low-fertility soils.Physcomitrium patensEnhanced PromptSummarize the biological and experimental objectives of the following Investigation based on the available metadata of its Studies and Assays.        You will receive identifiers, ontology annotations, and descriptive metadata for each component.        Extract relevant experimental factors and variables to construct a structured summary in two paragraphs:        - **Paragraph 1 (2-3 sentences):** Summarize the experimental objective of the Investigation        - **Paragraph 2 (5-7 sentences):** Describe the experimental design and methodology        Employ formal scientific language appropriate for an abstract and methods section.### Investigation Description:  The Arabidopsis COP1/SPA ubiquitin ligase suppresses photomorphogenesis in darkness. In the light, photoreceptors inactivate COP1/SPA to allow a light response. While SPA genes are specific to the green lineage, COP1 also exists in humans. This raises the question of when in evolution plant COP1 acquired the need for SPA accessory proteins. We addressed this question by generating Physcomitrium Ppcop1 mutants and comparing their visible and molecular phenotypes with those of Physcomitrium Ppspa mutants. The phenotype of Ppcop1 nonuple mutants resembles that of Ppspa mutants. Most importantly, both mutants produce green chloroplasts in complete darkness. They also exhibit dwarfed gametophores, disturbed branching of protonemata and absent gravitropism. RNA-sequencing analysis indicates that both mutants undergo weak constitutive light signaling in darkness. PpCOP1 and PpSPA proteins form a complex and they interact via their WD repeat domains with the VP motif of the cryptochrome CCE domain in a blue light-dependent manner. This resembles the interaction of Arabidopsis SPA proteins with Arabidopsis CRY1, and is different from that with Arabidopsis CRY2. Taken together, the data indicate that PpCOP1 and PpSPA act together to regulate growth and development of Physcomitrium. However, in contrast to their Arabidopsis orthologs, PpCOP1 and PpSPA proteins execute only partial suppression of light signaling in darkness. Hence, additional repressors may exist that contribute to the repression of a light response in dark-exposed Physcomitrium. ### Top-Level-Metadata:  | Meta Data | Description || --------- | ----------- || Submission Date | 7-Nov-2022 || Public Release Date | 7-Nov-2022 || Study identifiers | Ppatens || Study Count | 1 || Assay identifiers | Nanodrop , Bioanalyzer , RNASeq || Assay Count | 3 | ## Study_Ppatens_PpatensCharacteristics: (Organism: Physcomitrium patens ; Strain: Gransden ; Plate: 270820_D1, 270820_D2, 270820_D4, 270820_L2, 270820_L3, 270820_L4, 270820_D3, 270820_L1, 270820_L5 ; tissue: Protonemal filaments ; Laboratory strain: Gd_DE_MR, Gd_Berlin) ## Study_Ppatens_HarvestingCharacteristics: (Date: 09/18/2020 00)Parameters: (sample label: cop D1, cop D2, cop D4, cop L2, cop L3, cop L4, spa D1, spa D3, spa D4, spa L1, spa L4, spa L5, WT D1, WT D2, WT D4, WT L1, WT L2, WT L3 ; weight: 100 mg ; Protocol: own ; Person: Melanie Kreiss, Maike Hansen ; Comment: Protonemal filaments were harvested and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.

Specifically, it aimed to determine whether COP1 in this early land plant requires SPA proteins for its role in repressing photomorphogenesis in darkness, as observed in *Arabidopsis thaliana*, and to characterize the molecular and phenotypic consequences of COP1 and SPA loss-of-function mutations.To achieve this, the study employed a comparative genetic approach using *P. patens* nonuple Ppcop1 and Ppspa mutants alongside wild-type controls. Plants were cultivated under two conditions: complete darkness and a shift from darkness to white light exposure. Protonemal filaments were harvested following 2 weeks of dark pretreatment, with or without a 24-hour light exposure, and total RNA was extracted using a Qiagen RNeasy Kit with on-column DNase digestion. RNA quantity and purity were assessed using Nanodrop spectrophotometry, while RNA integrity was verified by Agilent Bioanalyzer analysis. High-throughput transcriptome profiling was conducted via paired-end RNA-seq using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform. The study analyzed differential gene expression patterns in relation to phenotypic traits such as chloroplast development, gametophore morphology, and gravitropic response, thereby linking the partial de-repression of light signaling in darkness to disrupted COP1-SPA function.Hybrid Prompt### Investigation Description:  The Arabidopsis COP1/SPA ubiquitin ligase suppresses photomorphogenesis in darkness.

Specifically, the study aimed to compare the phenotypic and molecular effects of *Ppcop1* and *Ppspa* mutants to assess their functional co-action in dark versus light conditions, and to evaluate their interactions with cryptochromes in the regulation of light signaling pathways.To address these aims, *Physcomitrium patens* Gransden strain was cultivated under controlled conditions, including prolonged darkness and brief exposure to white light. Protonemal filaments were harvested from wild-type, *Ppcop1*, and *Ppspa* mutants, snap-frozen, and subjected to RNA extraction using the Qiagen RNeasy Kit with on-column DNA digestion. The experimental design contrasted dark-grown versus light-treated samples across mutant and wild-type backgrounds. RNA quantity and quality were assessed using Thermo Fisher Nanodrop and Agilent Bioanalyzer platforms, confirming high integrity and purity. Subsequently, transcriptomic profiling was performed using Illumina NovaSeq 6000-based RNA-seq on paired-end libraries, enabling differential gene expression analysis. Phenotypic observations, supported by RNA-seq data, revealed that both *Ppcop1* and *Ppspa* mutants exhibited constitutive light signaling in darkness, chloroplast development, and abnormal growth patterns. Interaction assays confirmed that PpCOP1 and PpSPA form a light-dependent complex with cryptochrome, suggesting a partially conserved yet distinct mechanism from that in *Arabidopsis*, highlighting the evolutionary divergence of light signal repression in basal land plants.Basic PromptSummarize the biological and experimental objectives of the following Investigation based on the available metadata of its Studies and Assays.        You will receive identifiers, ontology annotations, and descriptive metadata for each component.        Extract relevant experimental factors and variables to construct a structured summary in two paragraphs:        - **Paragraph 1 (2-3 sentences):** Summarize the experimental objective of the Investigation        - **Paragraph 2 (5-7 sentences):** Describe the experimental design and methodology        Employ formal scientific language appropriate for an abstract and methods section.### Investigation Description:  The Arabidopsis COP1/SPA ubiquitin ligase suppresses photomorphogenesis in darkness.

Specifically, it seeks to determine whether the requirement of SPA proteins for COP1 activity, as observed in Arabidopsis, is conserved in basal land plants, thereby shedding light on the evolutionary trajectory of photomorphogenesis regulation.The experimental design involves generating *P. patens* mutants deficient in either **COP1** or **SPA** genes and comparing their phenotypic and transcriptomic profiles under controlled light conditions. Protonemal filaments of wild-type, cop1, and spa mutants were cultivated under two regimes: continuous darkness or darkness followed by white light exposure, using Knop medium at 70 µmolám??ás?? light intensity. Eighteen samples were harvested, snap-frozen, and processed for RNA extraction using the Qiagen RNeasy Kit. RNA quality and concentration were assessed using Nanodrop spectrophotometry and Agilent Bioanalyzer electrophoresis, ensuring high integrity for downstream sequencing. High-throughput RNA sequencing was performed using paired-end libraries on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform. The resulting transcriptomic data allowed comparison of light-responsive gene expression among genotypes and conditions, revealing partial derepression of light signaling in the mutants under dark conditions. This comprehensive experimental approach provides molecular and phenotypic evidence for the cooperative yet non-redundant function of COP1 and SPA proteins in repressing photomorphogenesis in moss.Historical Phenotype IPKBasic promptSummarize the biological and experimental objectives of the following Investigation based on the available metadata of its Studies and Assays.        You will receive identifiers, ontology annotations, and descriptive metadata for each component.        Extract relevant experimental factors and variables to construct a structured summary in two paragraphs:        - **Paragraph 1 (2-3 sentences):** Summarize the experimental objective of the Investigation        - **Paragraph 2 (5-7 sentences):** Describe the experimental design and methodology        Employ formal scientific language appropriate for an abstract and methods section.### Investigation Description:  This dataset comprises records collected during the seed regeneration routine of the wheat collection hosted at the Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research (IPK)### Top-Level-Metadata:  | Meta Data | Description || --------- | ----------- || Study identifiers | s_winter_wheat , s_spring_wheat || Study Count | 2 || Assay identifiers | a_winter_wheat || Assay Count | 1 | ## Study_s_winter_wheat_GrowthCharacteristics: (Organism: Triticum aestivum ; Material source ID (Holding institute/stock centre, accession): TRI 10, TRI 100, TRI 10003, TRI 1001, TRI 1002, TRI 10026, TRI 1003, TRI 10049, TRI 1005 ; Material source DOI: 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/10, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/100, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/1000, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/9975, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/1001, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/1002, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/9998, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/1003, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/10021, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/1005 ; Origin Country: United States, Sweden, Germany, French Republic, The Netherlands, [Former] Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, United Kingdom)Factors: sowing date: 22.10.1945)### Additional Details s_winter_wheat  | Meta Data | Description || --------- | ----------- || Table Count | 1 || Table Names | Growth || Sample Count | 10 || Data File Count | 0 || Associated assays | a_winter_wheat || Organisms | _Triticum aestivum_ || Biological replicates | 0 | ## Study_s_spring_wheat_GrowthCharacteristics: (Organism: Triticum aestivum ; Material source ID (Holding institute/stock centre, accession): TRI 10, TRI 100, TRI 10003, TRI 1001, TRI 1002, TRI 10026, TRI 1003, TRI 10049, TRI 1005 ; Material source DOI: 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/10, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/100, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/1000, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/9975, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/1001, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/1002, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/9998, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/1003, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/10021, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/1005 ; Origin Country: United States, Sweden, Germany, French Republic, The Netherlands, [Former] Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, United Kingdom)Factors: sowing date: 22.10.1945)### Additional Details s_spring_wheat  | Meta Data | Description || --------- | ----------- || Table Count | 1 || Table Names | Growth || Sample Count | 10 || Data File Count | 0 || Associated assays | a_winter_wheat || Organisms | _Triticum aestivum_ || Biological replicates | 0 | ## Assay_a_winter_wheat_HarvestParameters: (Year: 1946)### Additional Details a_winter_wheat  | Meta Data | Description || --------- | ----------- || Table Count | 3 || Table Names | Harvest , Phenotyping , Seed Regeneration || Sample Count | 10 || Data File Count | 20 || Associated studies | s_winter_wheat,s_spring_wheat |OutputThe objective of this investigation is to document and evaluate the outcomes of seed regeneration processes conducted on accessions of *Triticum aestivum* (common wheat) from the IPK genebank collection. The experimental focus is on preserving genetic material through controlled regeneration of both winter and spring wheat varieties under uniform environmental and temporal conditions.The experimental design encompasses two distinct studiesÑone for winter wheat and one for spring wheatÑeach comprising 10 accessions sourced from a range of countries including the United States, Sweden, Germany, France, the Netherlands, the former USSR, and the United Kingdom. All accessions were sown on the same date, October 22, 1945, indicating a synchronized start to growth under comparable field conditions. The associated assay covers three key stages: harvest, phenotyping, and seed regeneration, all conducted within the year 1946. Despite being categorized into separate seasonal growth types, both studies utilized the same assay pipeline, suggesting parallel methodological treatment. Biological replication was not applied, implying that each accession was treated as a unique genetic unit. Data were compiled into structured tables reflecting phenotypic traits and regeneration metrics, though no raw data files were included for growth studies. This uniform and well-documented experimental design supports the long-term conservation and genetic characterization of wheat germplasm.Hybrid prompt### Investigation Description:  This dataset comprises records collected during the seed regeneration routine of the wheat collection hosted at the Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research (IPK)### Top-Level-Metadata:  | Meta Data | Description || --------- | ----------- || Study identifiers | s_winter_wheat , s_spring_wheat || Study Count | 2 || Assay identifiers | a_winter_wheat || Assay Count | 1 | ## Study_s_winter_wheat_GrowthCharacteristics: (Organism: Triticum aestivum ; Material source ID (Holding institute/stock centre, accession): TRI 10, TRI 100, TRI 10003, TRI 1001, TRI 1002, TRI 10026, TRI 1003, TRI 10049, TRI 1005 ; Material source DOI: 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/10, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/100, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/1000, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/9975, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/1001, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/1002, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/9998, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/1003, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/10021, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/1005 ; Origin Country: United States, Sweden, Germany, French Republic, The Netherlands, [Former] Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, United Kingdom)Factors: sowing date: 22.10.1945)### Additional Details s_winter_wheat  | Meta Data | Description || --------- | ----------- || Table Count | 1 || Table Names | Growth || Sample Count | 10 || Data File Count | 0 || Associated assays | a_winter_wheat || Organisms | _Triticum aestivum_ || Biological replicates | 0 | ## Study_s_spring_wheat_GrowthCharacteristics: (Organism: Triticum aestivum ; Material source ID (Holding institute/stock centre, accession): TRI 10, TRI 100, TRI 10003, TRI 1001, TRI 1002, TRI 10026, TRI 1003, TRI 10049, TRI 1005 ; Material source DOI: 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/10, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/100, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/1000, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/9975, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/1001, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/1002, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/9998, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/1003, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/10021, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/1005 ; Origin Country: United States, Sweden, Germany, French Republic, The Netherlands, [Former] Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, United Kingdom)Factors: sowing date: 22.10.1945)### Additional Details s_spring_wheat  | Meta Data | Description || --------- | ----------- || Table Count | 1 || Table Names | Growth || Sample Count | 10 || Data File Count | 0 || Associated assays | a_winter_wheat || Organisms | _Triticum aestivum_ || Biological replicates | 0 |### Study Table Associations (indicate with --> an input/output link):  Study_s_winter_wheat_Growth --> Assay_a_winter_wheat_Harvest,Study_s_spring_wheat_Growth --> Assay_a_winter_wheat_Harvest,Study_s_winter_wheat_Growth --> Assay_a_winter_wheat_Phenotyping,Study_s_spring_wheat_Growth --> Assay_a_winter_wheat_Phenotyping  ## Assay_a_winter_wheat_HarvestParameters: (Year: 1946)### Additional Details a_winter_wheat  | Meta Data | Description || --------- | ----------- || Table Count | 3 || Table Names | Harvest , Phenotyping , Seed Regeneration || Sample Count | 10 || Data File Count | 20 || Associated studies | s_winter_wheat,s_spring_wheat | ### Assay Table Associations (indicate with --> an input/output link):  Assay_a_winter_wheat_Harvest --> Assay_a_winter_wheat_Seed Regeneration         ### Instructions         1.

The study aims to characterize growth responses under controlled sowing conditions and to generate phenotypic and harvest data that support genetic resource preservation and regeneration practices.The experimental design involves two studiesÑs\_winter\_wheat and s\_spring\_wheatÑeach examining a common set of *Triticum aestivum* accessions originating from diverse geographic regions including the United States, Sweden, Germany, France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the former USSR. Both studies share a single treatment factor: a uniform sowing date of October 22, 1945, enabling comparison of growth behavior across seasonal wheat types under identical agronomic conditions. Growth observations from each study feed into the assay a\_winter\_wheat, which encompasses three stages: Harvest (conducted in 1946), Phenotyping, and Seed Regeneration. This hierarchical linkage of study tables to assay outputs ensures traceability of phenotypic traits and harvest outcomes to their originating genetic materials. While no biological replicates were reported, the use of standardized accession identifiers and DOIs ensures data integrity across studies. The methodology emphasizes structured regeneration and documentation protocols vital for long-term seed conservation.Enhanced Prompt Summarize the biological and experimental objectives of the following Investigation based on the available metadata of its Studies and Assays.        You will receive identifiers, ontology annotations, and descriptive metadata for each component.        Extract relevant experimental factors and variables to construct a structured summary in two paragraphs:        - **Paragraph 1 (2-3 sentences):** Summarize the experimental objective of the Investigation        - **Paragraph 2 (5-7 sentences):** Describe the experimental design and methodology        Employ formal scientific language appropriate for an abstract and methods section.### Investigation Description:  This dataset comprises records collected during the seed regeneration routine of the wheat collection hosted at the Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research (IPK)### Top-Level-Metadata:  | Meta Data | Description || --------- | ----------- || Study identifiers | s_winter_wheat , s_spring_wheat || Study Count | 2 || Assay identifiers | a_winter_wheat || Assay Count | 1 | ## Study_s_winter_wheat_GrowthCharacteristics: (Organism: Triticum aestivum ; Material source ID (Holding institute/stock centre, accession): TRI 10, TRI 100, TRI 10003, TRI 1001, TRI 1002, TRI 10026, TRI 1003, TRI 10049, TRI 1005 ; Material source DOI: 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/10, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/100, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/1000, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/9975, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/1001, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/1002, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/9998, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/1003, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/10021, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/1005 ; Origin Country: United States, Sweden, Germany, French Republic, The Netherlands, [Former] Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, United Kingdom)Factors: sowing date: 22.10.1945)### Additional Details s_winter_wheat  | Meta Data | Description || --------- | ----------- || Table Count | 1 || Table Names | Growth || Sample Count | 10 || Data File Count | 0 || Associated assays | a_winter_wheat || Organisms | _Triticum aestivum_ || Biological replicates | 0 | ## Study_s_spring_wheat_GrowthCharacteristics: (Organism: Triticum aestivum ; Material source ID (Holding institute/stock centre, accession): TRI 10, TRI 100, TRI 10003, TRI 1001, TRI 1002, TRI 10026, TRI 1003, TRI 10049, TRI 1005 ; Material source DOI: 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/10, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/100, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/1000, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/9975, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/1001, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/1002, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/9998, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/1003, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/10021, 10.25642/IPK/GBIS/1005 ; Origin Country: United States, Sweden, Germany, French Republic, The Netherlands, [Former] Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, United Kingdom)Factors: sowing date: 22.10.1945)### Additional Details s_spring_wheat  | Meta Data | Description || --------- | ----------- || Table Count | 1 || Table Names | Growth || Sample Count | 10 || Data File Count | 0 || Associated assays | a_winter_wheat || Organisms | _Triticum aestivum_ || Biological replicates | 0 |### Study Table Associations (indicate with --> an input/output link):  Study_s_winter_wheat_Growth --> Assay_a_winter_wheat_Harvest,Study_s_spring_wheat_Growth --> Assay_a_winter_wheat_Harvest,Study_s_winter_wheat_Growth --> Assay_a_winter_wheat_Phenotyping,Study_s_spring_wheat_Growth --> Assay_a_winter_wheat_Phenotyping ## Assay_a_winter_wheat_HarvestParameters: (Year: 1946)### Additional Details a_winter_wheat  | Meta Data | Description || --------- | ----------- || Table Count | 3 || Table Names | Harvest , Phenotyping , Seed Regeneration || Sample Count | 10 || Data File Count | 20 || Associated studies | s_winter_wheat,s_spring_wheat |### Assay Table Associations (indicate with --> an input/output link):  Assay_a_winter_wheat_Harvest --> Assay_a_winter_wheat_Seed RegenerationOutputThe primary objective of this investigation is to support the seed regeneration process of *Triticum aestivum* (common wheat) accessions maintained in the wheat collection at the Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research (IPK). The study aims to document and standardize growth and phenotypic data for both winter and spring wheat varieties to ensure the conservation, genetic integrity, and viability of germplasm accessions.The experimental design includes two distinct studies focusing on winter and spring wheat accessions, respectively, with each involving a set of ten accessions sourced from diverse geographic origins, including the United States, Sweden, Germany, France, the Netherlands, the former USSR, and the United Kingdom. Both studies employed a uniform sowing date of October 22, 1945, and shared common downstream assays for harvest and phenotyping conducted in 1946. These studies were linked to a single assay (a\_winter\_wheat) that encompasses three phases: phenotyping, harvest, and seed regeneration. Although no biological replicates were reported, consistent accession identifiers and shared protocols suggest a standardized approach to sample handling. Data were collected across multiple tables but without accompanying raw data files, emphasizing metadata-driven documentation. The consistent methodology across both studies enables comparative assessment of growth traits under identical environmental and temporal conditions.Maleckova TalinumEnhanced PromptSummarize the biological and experimental objectives of the following Investigation based on the available metadata of its Studies and Assays.        You will receive identifiers, ontology annotations, and descriptive metadata for each component.        Extract relevant experimental factors and variables to construct a structured summary in two paragraphs:        - **Paragraph 1 (2-3 sentences):** Summarize the experimental objective of the Investigation        - **Paragraph 2 (5-7 sentences):** Describe the experimental design and methodology        Employ formal scientific language appropriate for an abstract and methods section.### Investigation Description:  Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) has evolved as a water-saving strategy, and its engineering into crops offers an opportunity to improve their water use efficiency. This requires a comprehensive understanding of the regulation of the CAM pathway. Here, we use the facultative CAM species Talinum triangulare as a model in which CAM can be induced rapidly by exogenous abscisic acid. RNA sequencing and metabolite measurements were employed to analyse the changes underlying CAM induction and identify potential CAM regulators. Non-negative matrix factorization followed by k-means clustering identified an early CAM-specific cluster and a late one, which was specific for the early light phase. Enrichment analysis revealed abscisic acid metabolism, WRKY-regulated transcription, sugar and nutrient transport, and protein degradation in these clusters. Activation of the CAM pathway was supported by up-regulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, cytosolic and chloroplastic malic enzymes, and several transport proteins, as well as by increased end-of-night titratable acidity and malate accumulation.

By employing abscisic acid (ABA) as an external inducer, the study aims to identify early and late regulatory responses associated with CAM activation, with the broader goal of informing CAM engineering strategies for improving water-use efficiency in crops.The experimental design integrates transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling to capture dynamic molecular changes during ABA-induced CAM induction. Plants were subjected to controlled environmental conditions (25?¡C day/23?¡C night) and exposed to either mock or ABA treatments. Samples were collected at six timepoints ranging from 40 to 1280 minutes post-treatment, enabling a high-resolution temporal analysis of CAM activation. Assays included mRNA sequencing (via Illumina HiSeq 3000), titratable acidity measurements, protein and starch quantification, and untargeted metabolite profiling using LC-qTOF and GC-MS platforms. Detailed sample preparation steps involved rigorous extraction protocols, centrifugation, enzymatic digestion, and precise chromatographic conditions. Analytical outputs were subjected to non-negative matrix factorization and clustering to identify co-regulated gene-metabolite modules, highlighting candidate transcription factors (HSFA2, NF-YA9, and JMJ27) and confirming upregulation of key CAM enzymes. This integrative approach supports the use of *T. triangulare* as a model for dissecting inducible CAM regulation.Hybrid Prompt### Investigation Description:  Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) has evolved as a water-saving strategy, and its engineering into crops offers an opportunity to improve their water use efficiency. This requires a comprehensive understanding of the regulation of the CAM pathway. Here, we use the facultative CAM species Talinum triangulare as a model in which CAM can be induced rapidly by exogenous abscisic acid. RNA sequencing and metabolite measurements were employed to analyse the changes underlying CAM induction and identify potential CAM regulators. Non-negative matrix factorization followed by k-means clustering identified an early CAM-specific cluster and a late one, which was specific for the early light phase. Enrichment analysis revealed abscisic acid metabolism, WRKY-regulated transcription, sugar and nutrient transport, and protein degradation in these clusters. Activation of the CAM pathway was supported by up-regulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, cytosolic and chloroplastic malic enzymes, and several transport proteins, as well as by increased end-of-night titratable acidity and malate accumulation. The transcription factors HSFA2, NF-YA9, and JMJ27 were identified as candidate regulators of CAM induction. With this study we promote the model species T. triangulare, in which CAM can be induced in a controlled way, enabling further deciphering of CAM regulation.<<Test ARC registry>>### Top-Level-Metadata:  | Meta Data | Description || --------- | ----------- || Public Release Date | 24.04.2019 || Study identifiers | Maleckova2018_aba || Study Count | 1 || Assay identifiers | TitratableAcidity , ProteinAndStarchMeasurements , CMML_18-0008_LCqTOF , CMML_18-0008_GC-MS , Maleckova2018_aba_mRNASeq , CMML_18-0008_LCqTOF-MasshunterQuant , CMML_18-0008_GC-MS-MasshunterQuant , CMML_18-0008_HPLC-DAD || Assay Count | 8 | ## Study_Maleckova2018_aba_plant_materialParameters: (light intensity exposure: microeinstein per square meter per second ;

By integrating RNA sequencing and metabolomic profiling, the study aimed to identify early and late transcriptional and metabolic changes associated with CAM induction and uncover candidate regulatory genes that facilitate this transition.To achieve these goals, *T. triangulare* plants were subjected to either mock or ABA treatment across six timepoints ranging from 40 to 1280 minutes post-treatment, under controlled light and temperature conditions. Harvested tissues were processed through multiple assay pipelines encompassing titratable acidity, starch and protein measurements, and high-throughput RNA-seq, as well as liquid and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LCqTOF and GC-MS) for metabolite profiling. The design allowed for temporal dissection of CAM-associated processes, with key metabolic markers such as malate and titratable acidity confirming CAM activation. Non-negative matrix factorization and k-means clustering of transcriptomic data revealed temporally distinct CAM-specific gene clusters, with functional enrichment pointing to roles for ABA metabolism, WRKY transcription factors, and transport mechanisms. Notably, transcription factors HSFA2, NF-YA9, and JMJ27 emerged as candidate regulators of CAM induction. This study thereby validates *T. triangulare* as a controlled model system for dissecting inducible CAM and provides a foundation for engineering CAM traits in crop species.Basic PromptSummarize the biological and experimental objectives of the following Investigation based on the available metadata of its Studies and Assays.        You will receive identifiers, ontology annotations, and descriptive metadata for each component.        Extract relevant experimental factors and variables to construct a structured summary in two paragraphs:        - **Paragraph 1 (2-3 sentences):** Summarize the experimental objective of the Investigation        - **Paragraph 2 (5-7 sentences):** Describe the experimental design and methodology        Employ formal scientific language appropriate for an abstract and methods section.### Investigation Description:  Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) has evolved as a water-saving strategy, and its engineering into crops offers an opportunity to improve their water use efficiency.

By employing exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) as an inducer, the study seeks to identify early and late regulatory events, transcriptional changes, and key metabolic transitions associated with CAM pathway activation.The study comprises a single experimental study (Maleckova2018\_aba) in which *T. triangulare* plants were subjected to controlled environmental conditions (25¡C day/23¡C night, defined light intensity) and treated with either mock or ABA at multiple timepoints (40 to 1280 minutes). RNA sequencing (mRNASeq) and targeted metabolite profiling (LC-qTOF and GC-MS) were performed to track transcriptional and biochemical dynamics. Eight assays in total were conducted, including titratable acidity measurements to assess CAM activity, protein and starch quantification, and untargeted metabolite profiling using liquid and gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. RNA was extracted using a standardized kit and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 3000 platform, with libraries prepared via a stranded mRNA protocol. Data from these multi-omics assays were integrated using non-negative matrix factorization and k-means clustering to distinguish early and late CAM-specific responses, revealing transcriptional regulators and metabolic pathways involved in ABA-mediated CAM induction.RU_ChlamyHeatstressEnhanced PromptSummarize the biological and experimental objectives of the following Investigation based on the available metadata of its Studies and Assays.        You will receive identifiers, ontology annotations, and descriptive metadata for each component.        Extract relevant experimental factors and variables to construct a structured summary in two paragraphs:        - **Paragraph 1 (2-3 sentences):** Summarize the experimental objective of the Investigation        - **Paragraph 2 (5-7 sentences):** Describe the experimental design and methodology        Employ formal scientific language appropriate for an abstract and methods section.### Investigation Description:  Algae cultures were grown mixotrophically (TAP).

Biological triplicates were subjected to heat stress for 24 hours at 35?¡C or 40?¡C, followed by a 48-hour recovery at 25?¡C. Samples were collected at multiple pre-treatment, treatment, and post-recovery time points (spanning from -20 to 72 hours) for omics analyses. Transcriptomic samples underwent centrifugation, RNA extraction with TRIzol, and RNA-Seq using Illumina HiSeq 2000. Proteomic samples were harvested, sonicated, and digested using the PreOmics IST kit, followed by LC-MS/MS on the Orbitrap Fusion Lumos. Quantitative analyses employed MaxQuant software with stringent false discovery rate thresholds (1%).

Cultures were grown mixotrophically in TAP medium and subjected to a 24-hour temperature challenge at either moderate (35¡C) or acute (40¡C) conditions, then returned to a recovery temperature of 25¡C for 48 hours, during which omics samples were collected to assess molecular changes across time points.The study employed a controlled photobioreactor environment to ensure reproducibility, with biological triplicates sampled across various time points relative to the temperature shifts. The *Chlamydomonas* cultures were grown at a constant cell density of 2?10? cells/mL under defined light and aeration parameters. Experimental conditions included both control (25¡C) and heat stress treatments (35¡C and 40¡C), with samples harvested at critical time points including the onset and maintenance of both treatment and recovery phases. Transcriptomic data were generated through RNA-Seq following mRNA extraction using TRIzol and quality-checked via RIN scores, while proteomic profiling was conducted using mass spectrometry after protein extraction, enzymatic digestion, and peptide purification. Downstream analyses included RNA sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform and proteomic data acquisition via Orbitrap Fusion Lumos, with MaxQuant employed for computational analysis. The study design, linking temperature as a key experimental factor to multi-omics assays, enables comprehensive insight into cellular stress adaptation and recovery mechanisms.SFB175AraCoreEnhanced PromptSummarize the biological and experimental objectives of the following Investigation based on the available metadata of its Studies and Assays.        You will receive identifiers, ontology annotations, and descriptive metadata for each component.        Extract relevant experimental factors and variables to construct a structured summary in two paragraphs:        - **Paragraph 1 (2-3 sentences):** Summarize the experimental objective of the Investigation        - **Paragraph 2 (5-7 sentences):** Describe the experimental design and methodology        Employ formal scientific language appropriate for an abstract and methods section.### Top-Level-Metadata:  | Meta Data | Description || --------- | ----------- || Study identifiers | SFB175AraCore || Study Count | 1 || Assay identifiers | SFB175AraCoreTranscriptomics , SFB175AraCoreProteomics || Assay Count | 2 | ## Study_SFB175AraCore_GrowthCharacteristics: (Sample type: whole organism batch ;

Specifically, the study seeks to characterize acclimation and deacclimation processes at the transcriptomic and proteomic levels under controlled growth chamber conditions.The experimental design involves cultivating *Arabidopsis thaliana* Col-0 ecotype plants in soil under randomized growth plots and subjecting them to various environmental conditions, including cold (4¡C), heat (32¡C), and high light (up to 450 µmol m?? s??) exposures. Leaf tissue samples were collected at multiple time points (ranging from 0 to 11520 minutes) to capture dynamic molecular changes. Experimental variables include day and night temperature regimes, light intensity, and physiological state transitions (acclimation and deacclimation). Proteomic assays were conducted using trypsin digestion, iodoacetamide derivatization, and ^15N-labeled internal standards, followed by LC-MS/MS analysis on a Bruker impact II instrument. Data acquisition involved two technical replicates per sample and subsequent quantification using extracted ion chromatograms (XIC), processed via ProteomIQon. This comprehensive approach supports a high-resolution view of temporal proteomic shifts during stress adaptation.Hybrid Prompt### Top-Level-Metadata:  | Meta Data | Description || --------- | ----------- || Study identifiers | SFB175AraCore || Study Count | 1 || Assay identifiers | SFB175AraCoreTranscriptomics , SFB175AraCoreProteomics || Assay Count | 2 | ## Study_SFB175AraCore_GrowthCharacteristics: (Sample type: whole organism batch ; Biological replicate: 1, 2, 3, 4 ; Organism: Arabidopsis thaliana ; Ecotype: Col-0 ; Genotype: Col-0 ; study type: growth chamber study ; plant growth medium exposure: soil ; growth plot design: Random ; light intensity exposure: day light intensity exposure) ## Study_SFB175AraCore_ExperimentCharacteristics: (Sample type: tissue sample ; Organism part: leaf ; study type: growth chamber study ; plant growth medium exposure: soil ; growth plot design: Random)Parameters: ()Factors: plant experimental condition: Cold, Heat, High Light, Controll ; experimental_feature: Acclimation, Deacclimation ; Time point: 15, 2880, 180, 5760, 5775, 8640, 5940, 11520, 0 ; light intensity exposure: 35, 80, 450 ; Temperature Day: 4, 22, 32 ; Temperature Night: 4, 18, 32)### Additional Details SFB175AraCore  | Meta Data | Description || --------- | ----------- || Table Count | 2 || Table Names | Growth , Experiment || Sample Count | 101 || Data File Count | 0 || Associated assays | SFB175AraCoreProteomics || Organisms | _Arabidopsis thaliana_ || Genotype | _Col-0_ || Biological replicates | 4 || Time points | 1 |### Study Table Associations (indicate with --> an input/output link):  Study_SFB175AraCore_Growth --> Study_SFB175AraCore_Experiment,Study_SFB175AraCore_Experiment --> Assay_SFB175AraCoreProteomics_SamplePreparation  ## Assay_SFB175AraCoreProteomics_SamplePreparationParameters: (protease cleavage: trypsination ; protein modification: iodoacetamide derivatized residue ; Internal standard: N15 21.02, N15 24.02, N15 10.03, N15 03.03, N15 14-02-2020, N15 01.03, N15 28.02 ; sample pre-fractionation: False) ## Assay_SFB175AraCoreProteomics_MSMeasurementParameters: (run had to be repeated: False, True ; identifier: 44.1, 44.2, 100.1, 100.2, 67.1, 67.2, 17.1, 17.2, 40.1, 40.2, 76.1, 76.2, 58.1, 58.2, 19.1, 19.2, 23.1, 23.2, 21.1, 21.2, 94.1, 94.2, 73.1, 73.2, 13.1, 13.2, 48.1, 48.2, 52.1, 52.2, 91.1, 91.2, 3.1, 3.2, 9.1, 9.2, 82.1, 82.2, 29.1, 29.2, 106.1, 106.2, 66.1, 66.2, 75.1, 75.2, 8.1, 8.2, 70.1, 70.2, 27.1, 27.2, 1.1, 1.2, 61.1, 61.2, 39.1, 39.2, 95.1, 95.2, 30.1, 30.2, 83.1, 83.2, 18.1, 18.2, 57.1, 57.2, 101.1, 101.2, 22.1, 22.2, 69.1, 69.2, 92.1, 92.2, 16.1, 16.2, 74.1, 74.2, 47.1, 47.2, 12.1, 12.2, 50.1, 50.2, 35.1, 35.2, 102.1, 102.2, 42.1, 42.2, 88.1, 88.2, 32.1, 32.2, 2.1, 2.2, 85.1, 85.2, 46.1, 46.2, 10.1, 10.2, 20.1, 20.2, 90.1, 90.2, 56.1, 56.2, 79.1, 79.2, 103.1, 103.2, 64.1, 64.2, 97.1, 97.2, 26.1, 26.2, 51.1, 51.2, 15.1, 15.2, 38.1, 38.2, 60.1, 60.2, 11.1, 11.2, 28.1, 28.2, 71.1, 71.2, 86.1, 86.2, 33.1, 33.2, 54.1, 54.2, 63.1, 63.2, 104.1, 104.2, 96.1, 96.2, 87.1, 87.2, 5.1, 5.2, 24.1, 24.2, 84.1, 84.2, 45.1, 45.2, 36.1, 36.2, 49.1, 49.2, 7.1, 7.2, 53.1, 53.2, 31.1, 31.2, 98.1, 98.2, 55.1, 55.2, 89.1, 89.2, 59.1, 59.2, 62.1, 62.2, 25.1, 25.2, 34.1, 34.2, 105.1, 105.2, 81.1, 81.2, 107.1, 107.2, 65.1, 65.2, 80.1, 80.2, 14.1, 14.2, 41.1, 41.2, 37.1, 37.2, 78.1, 78.2, 72.1, 72.2, 93.1, 93.2 ; Experiment type: labeled ; Quantification method: XIC ; technical replicate: 1, 2 ; Number of injections: 2 ; instrument model: impact II) ## Assay_SFB175AraCoreProteomics_ProcessedDataParameters: (software: ProteomIQon)### Additional Details SFB175AraCoreProteomics  | Meta Data | Description || --------- | ----------- || Table Count | 3 || Table Names | SamplePreparation , MSMeasurement , ProcessedData || Sample Count | 202 || Data File Count | 0 || Associated studies | SFB175AraCore | ### Assay Table Associations (indicate with --> an input/output link):  Assay_SFB175AraCoreProteomics_SamplePreparation --> Assay_SFB175AraCoreProteomics_MSMeasurement,Assay_SFB175AraCoreProteomics_MSMeasurement --> Assay_SFB175AraCoreProteomics_ProcessedData         ### Instructions         1.

The study targets understanding how cold, heat, and high light stress, applied under controlled growth chamber conditions, modulate proteome profiles over specific time points and light intensities, thereby shedding light on temporal stress-response mechanisms in leaf tissues.The experimental design involves whole-organism batch cultivation followed by tissue-specific sampling (leaf) from biologically replicated plants (n=4), grown in soil under randomized plot design and daylight exposure. Experimental factors include varying environmental stress conditions (Cold, Heat, High Light, and Control), acclimation states (Acclimation, Deacclimation), a comprehensive set of time points (ranging from 0 to 11520 minutes), and distinct light (35, 80, 450 µmol m?? s??) and temperature regimens (day: 4¡C, 22¡C, 32¡C; night: 4¡C, 18¡C, 32¡C). Proteomic analysis was conducted following trypsination and iodoacetamide derivatization, with ^15N-labeled internal standards included during sample preparation. No pre-fractionation was employed. Mass spectrometry data were acquired using an impact II instrument under a labeled, XIC-based quantification scheme, incorporating two technical replicates and dual injections per sample. Downstream data processing was performed using the ProteomIQon software platform. The integrative structure of the study, linking growth and environmental condition data to proteomic assays through a series of systematically associated tables, enables robust interrogation of stress-responsive molecular adaptations.Basic promptSummarize the biological and experimental objectives of the following Investigation based on the available metadata of its Studies and Assays.        You will receive identifiers, ontology annotations, and descriptive metadata for each component.        Extract relevant experimental factors and variables to construct a structured summary in two paragraphs:        - **Paragraph 1 (2-3 sentences):** Summarize the experimental objective of the Investigation        - **Paragraph 2 (5-7 sentences):** Describe the experimental design and methodology        Employ formal scientific language appropriate for an abstract and methods section.### Top-Level-Metadata:  | Meta Data | Description || --------- | ----------- || Study identifiers | SFB175AraCore || Study Count | 1 || Assay identifiers | SFB175AraCoreTranscriptomics , SFB175AraCoreProteomics || Assay Count | 2 | ## Study_SFB175AraCore_GrowthCharacteristics: (Sample type: whole organism batch ; Biological replicate: 1, 2, 3, 4 ; Organism: Arabidopsis thaliana ; Ecotype: Col-0 ; Genotype: Col-0 ; study type: growth chamber study ; plant growth medium exposure: soil ; growth plot design: Random ; light intensity exposure: day light intensity exposure) ## Study_SFB175AraCore_ExperimentCharacteristics: (Sample type: tissue sample ; Organism part: leaf ; study type: growth chamber study ; plant growth medium exposure: soil ; growth plot design: Random)Parameters: ()Factors: plant experimental condition: Cold, Heat, High Light, Controll ; experimental_feature: Acclimation, Deacclimation ; Time point: 15, 2880, 180, 5760, 5775, 8640, 5940, 11520, 0 ; light intensity exposure: 35, 80, 450 ; Temperature Day: 4, 22, 32 ; Temperature Night: 4, 18, 32)### Additional Details SFB175AraCore  | Meta Data | Description || --------- | ----------- || Table Count | 2 || Table Names | Growth , Experiment || Sample Count | 101 || Data File Count | 0 || Associated assays | SFB175AraCoreProteomics || Organisms | _Arabidopsis thaliana_ || Genotype | _Col-0_ || Biological replicates | 4 || Time points | 1 | ## Assay_SFB175AraCoreProteomics_SamplePreparationParameters: (protease cleavage: trypsination ; protein modification: iodoacetamide derivatized residue ; Internal standard: N15 21.02, N15 24.02, N15 10.03, N15 03.03, N15 14-02-2020, N15 01.03, N15 28.02 ; sample pre-fractionation: False) ## Assay_SFB175AraCoreProteomics_MSMeasurementParameters: (run had to be repeated: False, True ; identifier: 44.1, 44.2, 100.1, 100.2, 67.1, 67.2, 17.1, 17.2, 40.1, 40.2, 76.1, 76.2, 58.1, 58.2, 19.1, 19.2, 23.1, 23.2, 21.1, 21.2, 94.1, 94.2, 73.1, 73.2, 13.1, 13.2, 48.1, 48.2, 52.1, 52.2, 91.1, 91.2, 3.1, 3.2, 9.1, 9.2, 82.1, 82.2, 29.1, 29.2, 106.1, 106.2, 66.1, 66.2, 75.1, 75.2, 8.1, 8.2, 70.1, 70.2, 27.1, 27.2, 1.1, 1.2, 61.1, 61.2, 39.1, 39.2, 95.1, 95.2, 30.1, 30.2, 83.1, 83.2, 18.1, 18.2, 57.1, 57.2, 101.1, 101.2, 22.1, 22.2, 69.1, 69.2, 92.1, 92.2, 16.1, 16.2, 74.1, 74.2, 47.1, 47.2, 12.1, 12.2, 50.1, 50.2, 35.1, 35.2, 102.1, 102.2, 42.1, 42.2, 88.1, 88.2, 32.1, 32.2, 2.1, 2.2, 85.1, 85.2, 46.1, 46.2, 10.1, 10.2, 20.1, 20.2, 90.1, 90.2, 56.1, 56.2, 79.1, 79.2, 103.1, 103.2, 64.1, 64.2, 97.1, 97.2, 26.1, 26.2, 51.1, 51.2, 15.1, 15.2, 38.1, 38.2, 60.1, 60.2, 11.1, 11.2, 28.1, 28.2, 71.1, 71.2, 86.1, 86.2, 33.1, 33.2, 54.1, 54.2, 63.1, 63.2, 104.1, 104.2, 96.1, 96.2, 87.1, 87.2, 5.1, 5.2, 24.1, 24.2, 84.1, 84.2, 45.1, 45.2, 36.1, 36.2, 49.1, 49.2, 7.1, 7.2, 53.1, 53.2, 31.1, 31.2, 98.1, 98.2, 55.1, 55.2, 89.1, 89.2, 59.1, 59.2, 62.1, 62.2, 25.1, 25.2, 34.1, 34.2, 105.1, 105.2, 81.1, 81.2, 107.1, 107.2, 65.1, 65.2, 80.1, 80.2, 14.1, 14.2, 41.1, 41.2, 37.1, 37.2, 78.1, 78.2, 72.1, 72.2, 93.1, 93.2 ; Experiment type: labeled ; Quantification method: XIC ; technical replicate: 1, 2 ; Number of injections: 2 ; instrument model: impact II) ## Assay_SFB175AraCoreProteomics_ProcessedDataParameters: (software: ProteomIQon)### Additional Details SFB175AraCoreProteomics  | Meta Data | Description || --------- | ----------- || Table Count | 3 || Table Names | SamplePreparation , MSMeasurement , ProcessedData || Sample Count | 202 || Data File Count | 0 || Associated studies | SFB175AraCore |OutputThe objective of the *SFB175AraCore* Investigation is to elucidate the molecular responses of *Arabidopsis thaliana* (ecotype Col-0) to various environmental stress conditions, focusing on acclimation and deacclimation phases under controlled growth chamber conditions. The study aims to characterize dynamic changes in gene and protein expression in response to cold, heat, and high light stress, thereby enhancing our understanding of plant stress adaptation mechanisms.The experimental design integrates transcriptomic and proteomic assays on leaf tissue samples collected from soil-grown plants subjected to combinations of temperature (day: 4¡C, 22¡C, 32¡C; night: 4¡C, 18¡C, 32¡C) and light intensity (35, 80, 450 µmol m?? s??) treatments. The study utilizes a randomized growth plot design and includes biological replicates (n=4) across a wide range of time points (0 to 11,520 minutes) to monitor temporal molecular responses during both acclimation and deacclimation. Proteomic analyses were performed using trypsin digestion and iodoacetamide derivatization, followed by isotopic labeling (N15) and mass spectrometry quantification via XIC on an *impact II* instrument. Technical replicates and dual injections ensured reproducibility, and data processing was conducted using ProteomIQon software. This comprehensive multi-omics approach enables the dissection of coordinated gene and protein expression patterns that underpin stress resilience in *Arabidopsis thaliana*.LPA 2 ComplexomeBasic PromptSummarize the biological and experimental objectives of the following Investigation based on the available metadata of its Studies and Assays.        You will receive identifiers, ontology annotations, and descriptive metadata for each component.        Extract relevant experimental factors and variables to construct a structured summary in two paragraphs:        - **Paragraph 1 (2-3 sentences):** Summarize the experimental objective of the Investigation        - **Paragraph 2 (5-7 sentences):** Describe the experimental design and methodology        Employ formal scientific language appropriate for an abstract and methods section.### Investigation Description:  "Using the complexome profiling technique we have obtained detailed insights into the function of the PSII biogenesis factor LPA2 in Chlamydomonas and have revealed novel proteins potentially interacting with PSII."### Top-Level-Metadata:  | Meta Data | Description || --------- | ----------- || Study identifiers | Cultivation || Study Count | 1 || Assay identifiers | phenotypic analysis , qPCR , Growth tests , Blotting , Cultivation || Assay Count | 5 | ## Study_Cultivation_StrainsParameters: (species: Chlamydomonas reinhardtii ; strain: CC-4533, LMJ.RY0402.141537 ; Genotype: wild type, lpa2 mutant, lpa2 mutant_comp ; Transformation: -, electroporation ; plasmid: -, pMBS683, pMBS684 ; complemented lines: -, c10, c11, HA) ## Study_Cultivation_CultivationParameters: (growth medium: TAP medium ; growth temperature: 25 user-specific ; cultivation type: flasks on rotary shaker ; light intensity: 30 user-specific ; harvesting method: centrifugation ; biological replicate: 1, 2, 3)### Additional Details Cultivation  | Meta Data | Description || --------- | ----------- || Table Count | 2 || Table Names | Strains , Cultivation || Sample Count | 6 || Data File Count | 0 || Associated assays | qPCR,Blotting,Cultivation || Genotype | _wild type , lpa2 mutant , lpa2 mutant_comp_ || Biological replicates | 0 | ## Assay_qPCR_HarvestingParameters: (biological replicate: 1, 2 ; harvesting method: centrifugation ; cell number: 10^8 user-specific ; centrifugation force: 4300 ; centrifugation duration: 2 user-specific ; resuspension buffer: 0.6 M NaCl, 0.1 M TrisÐHCl, pH 8, 10 mM EDTA, 4% SDS ; freezing method: flash frozen in liquid nitrogen ; storage temperature: -80 user-specific) ## Assay_qPCR_ExtractionParameters: (incubation temperature: 65 user-specific ; incubation duration: 10 user-specific ; added substance: KCl ; substance concentration: 2 user-specific ; incubation 2 duration: 15 user-specific ; incubation 2 temperature: on ice ; centrifugation duration: 15 user-specific ; centrifugation force: 16500 ; extraction buffer 1: phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol (25 ; extraction buffer 2: chloroform/isoamylalcohol (24 ; precipitation buffer: LiCl ; precipitation duration concentration: 8 user-specific ; precipitation duration: over night ; precipitated material: mRNA ; enrichment method: centrifugation ; centrifugation 2 force: 16500 ; centrifugation 2 duration: 15 user-specific ; resuspension buffer composition: RNase free H2O with 3M Na-Acetate ; resuspension buffer pH: 5.2 ; precipitation 2 duration: 45 user-specific ; precipitation 2 buffer: ethanol ; precipitation 2 buffer concentration: 100 user-specific ; precipitation 2 temperature: on ice ; washing buffer: ethanol ; washing buffer concentration: 70 ; enrichment 2 method: centrifugation ; processed material: pellet ; resuspension buffer 2: RNase free H2O ; RNA concentration measurement method: spectrophotometer ; RNA concentration instrument: NanoDrop 2000 ; RNA quality check: agarose gel) ## Assay_qPCR_PreparationParameters: (DNA removing agent: RNase-free Turbo DNase (Ambion) ; cDNA synthesis method: M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega), deoxynucleotide triphosphates, and oligo-d(T)18) ## Assay_qPCR_MeasurementParameters: (measurement method: qRT-PCR ; buffer: 5?

By comparing wild type, *lpa2* mutant, and complemented strains, the study sought to define the molecular consequences of LPA2 disruption on PSII assembly and stability.The study utilized genetically modified *Chlamydomonas* strains, including wild type (CC-4533), *lpa2* mutant (LMJ.RY0402.141537), and complemented lines (e.g., c10, c11), cultivated under controlled conditions in TAP medium at 25¡C under low light. Phenotypic and molecular characterization was conducted through a suite of assays including qPCR, western blotting, and growth tests under varying light intensities to assess photosynthetic performance. Complexome profiling was achieved via BN-PAGE separation of native protein complexes followed by trypsin digestion, peptide extraction, and mass spectrometry (MS) using a TripleTOF 6600 system. MS data were processed with MaxQuant against a reference genome to determine protein composition and distribution across gel slices. Quantitative gene expression analysis targeted PSII-associated transcripts (e.g., *LPA2*, *CBLP2*, *TUB1*) using reverse transcription qPCR, while immunoblotting employed antibodies against key PSII subunits and control proteins.

Specifically, the study focused on characterizing the effects of **LPA2 loss-of-function** and **complementation** in mutant strains, and on identifying novel **protein interactors** of Photosystem II (PSII), thereby enhancing our understanding of PSII assembly and maintenance.To achieve this, a comparative experimental design was employed using wild-type, **lpa2 mutant**, and **complemented mutant lines** (c10, c11, HA) cultivated under controlled conditions in **TAP medium at 25¡C** with a **light intensity of 30 µmol photons m?? s??**. Biological replicates were subjected to **phenotypic assays** including **qPCR** for gene expression profiling (LPA2, CBLP2, TUB1), **Western blotting** for PSII protein subunits (e.g., D1, CP43, CP47), and **growth tests** under varying light and nutrient conditions. PSII complex composition and protein-protein interactions were analyzed through **Blue Native PAGE** followed by **mass spectrometry-based proteomics** using a TripleTOF 6600 platform. RNA extraction and protein processing protocols incorporated rigorous steps for nucleic acid purification, quantification, and buffer optimization. The resulting peptide spectra were computationally processed via **MaxQuant** using *Chlamydomonas* genome version 5.5. Together, the integration of genetic, biochemical, and proteomic approaches enabled a multifaceted analysis of PSII biogenesis mediated by LPA2.Enhanced PromptSummarize the biological and experimental objectives of the following Investigation based on the available metadata of its Studies and Assays.        You will receive identifiers, ontology annotations, and descriptive metadata for each component.        Extract relevant experimental factors and variables to construct a structured summary in two paragraphs:        - **Paragraph 1 (2-3 sentences):** Summarize the experimental objective of the Investigation        - **Paragraph 2 (5-7 sentences):** Describe the experimental design and methodology        Employ formal scientific language appropriate for an abstract and methods section.### Investigation Description:  "Using the complexome profiling technique we have obtained detailed insights into the function of the PSII biogenesis factor LPA2 in Chlamydomonas and have revealed novel proteins potentially interacting with PSII."### Top-Level-Metadata:  | Meta Data | Description || --------- | ----------- || Study identifiers | Cultivation || Study Count | 1 || Assay identifiers | phenotypic analysis , qPCR , Growth tests , Blotting , Cultivation || Assay Count | 5 | ## Study_Cultivation_StrainsParameters: (species: Chlamydomonas reinhardtii ; strain: CC-4533, LMJ.RY0402.141537 ; Genotype: wild type, lpa2 mutant, lpa2 mutant_comp ; Transformation: -, electroporation ; plasmid: -, pMBS683, pMBS684 ; complemented lines: -, c10, c11, HA) ## Study_Cultivation_CultivationParameters: (growth medium: TAP medium ; growth temperature: 25 user-specific ; cultivation type: flasks on rotary shaker ; light intensity: 30 user-specific ; harvesting method: centrifugation ; biological replicate: 1, 2, 3)### Additional Details Cultivation  | Meta Data | Description || --------- | ----------- || Table Count | 2 || Table Names | Strains , Cultivation || Sample Count | 6 || Data File Count | 0 || Associated assays | qPCR,Blotting,Cultivation || Genotype | _wild type , lpa2 mutant , lpa2 mutant_comp_ || Biological replicates | 0 |### Study Table Associations (indicate with --> an input/output link):  Study_Cultivation_Strains --> Study_Cultivation_Cultivation,Study_Cultivation_Strains --> Assay_qPCR_Harvesting,Study_Cultivation_Strains --> Assay_Blotting_Blotting,Study_Cultivation_Cultivation --> Assay_Cultivation_Harvesting ## Assay_qPCR_HarvestingParameters: (biological replicate: 1, 2 ; harvesting method: centrifugation ; cell number: 10^8 user-specific ; centrifugation force: 4300 ; centrifugation duration: 2 user-specific ; resuspension buffer: 0.6 M NaCl, 0.1 M TrisÐHCl, pH 8, 10 mM EDTA, 4% SDS ; freezing method: flash frozen in liquid nitrogen ; storage temperature: -80 user-specific) ## Assay_qPCR_ExtractionParameters: (incubation temperature: 65 user-specific ; incubation duration: 10 user-specific ; added substance: KCl ; substance concentration: 2 user-specific ; incubation 2 duration: 15 user-specific ; incubation 2 temperature: on ice ; centrifugation duration: 15 user-specific ; centrifugation force: 16500 ; extraction buffer 1: phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol (25 ; extraction buffer 2: chloroform/isoamylalcohol (24 ; precipitation buffer: LiCl ; precipitation duration concentration: 8 user-specific ; precipitation duration: over night ; precipitated material: mRNA ; enrichment method: centrifugation ; centrifugation 2 force: 16500 ; centrifugation 2 duration: 15 user-specific ; resuspension buffer composition: RNase free H2O with 3M Na-Acetate ; resuspension buffer pH: 5.2 ; precipitation 2 duration: 45 user-specific ; precipitation 2 buffer: ethanol ; precipitation 2 buffer concentration: 100 user-specific ; precipitation 2 temperature: on ice ; washing buffer: ethanol ; washing buffer concentration: 70 ; enrichment 2 method: centrifugation ; processed material: pellet ; resuspension buffer 2: RNase free H2O ; RNA concentration measurement method: spectrophotometer ; RNA concentration instrument: NanoDrop 2000 ; RNA quality check: agarose gel) ## Assay_qPCR_PreparationParameters: (DNA removing agent: RNase-free Turbo DNase (Ambion) ; cDNA synthesis method: M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega), deoxynucleotide triphosphates, and oligo-d(T)18) ## Assay_qPCR_MeasurementParameters: (measurement method: qRT-PCR ; buffer: 5?

Through a comparative analysis of wild-type, *lpa2* mutant, and complemented *lpa2* strains, the study sought to uncover molecular alterations in photosystem II (PSII) assembly and identify novel proteins potentially interacting with PSII.The experimental design involved the cultivation of *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii* under standardized conditions, followed by comprehensive phenotypic and molecular analyses. Strains including wild-type, *lpa2* mutants, and complemented lines (e.g., c10, c11, HA) were grown in TAP medium at 25¡C under controlled light intensity. Protein complexes were isolated via BN-PAGE after differential centrifugation and sonication, with further digestion and peptide extraction for LC-MS/MS analysis on a TripleTOF 6600 platform. Gene expression levels of *LPA2* and control transcripts were quantified using qRT-PCR following RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis. Western blotting employing antibodies against PSII subunits and control proteins assessed protein accumulation. Additionally, growth assays on agar plates under varying light conditions and media (TAP, HSM) evaluated phenotypic effects. All assays were systematically linked across harvesting, sample preparation, and data acquisition pipelines to ensure integrative analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic changes.Wheat IPK 2.0 Basic PromptSummarize the biological and experimental objectives of the following Investigation based on the available metadata of its Studies and Assays.        You will receive identifiers, ontology annotations, and descriptive metadata for each component.        Extract relevant experimental factors and variables to construct a structured summary in two paragraphs:        - **Paragraph 1 (2-3 sentences):** Summarize the experimental objective of the Investigation        - **Paragraph 2 (5-7 sentences):** Describe the experimental design and methodology        Employ formal scientific language appropriate for an abstract and methods section.### Investigation Description:  This dataset comprises records collected during the seed regeneration routine of the wheat collection hosted at the Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research (IPK)### Top-Level-Metadata:  | Meta Data | Description || --------- | ----------- || Submission Date | 2019-03-19T15:04 || Public Release Date | 2019-07-29T12:00 || Study identifiers | s_winter_wheat , s_spring_wheat , s_weather || Study Count | 3 || Assay identifiers | a_spring_wheat , a_winter_wheat , a_weather || Assay Count | 3 | ## Study_s_winter_wheat_GrowthCharacteristics: (Organism: Triticum aestivum ; Material source ID (Holding institute/stock centre, accession): TRI 10 ...

This study encompasses both winter and spring wheat varieties and includes a comprehensive set of environmental variables to examine the impact of diverse climatic conditions on wheat seed viability and growth.The experimental design includes three main studies: **s\_winter\_wheat**, **s\_spring\_wheat**, and **s\_weather**, focusing on different wheat accessions and their environmental conditions. The wheat collection, consisting of over 27,000 accessions of *Triticum aestivum*, includes diverse origins, and accessions were documented with detailed passport information, such as country of origin and collection site. Growth data from both winter and spring wheat varieties were collected over several decades (1945Ð1981), with sowing dates as a key factor. The associated assays, **a\_spring\_wheat** and **a\_winter\_wheat**, tracked seed regeneration and phenotyping across multiple years, capturing various environmental parameters such as air temperature, precipitation, and humidity. The **s\_weather** study provides historical weather data, including monthly averages of air temperature, precipitation, and humidity from 1953 to 2015, which were used to correlate environmental conditions with wheat growth patterns. The data from these studies were collected under varying climatic conditions and included different sowing dates, allowing for the investigation of temporal and environmental effects on seed regeneration. The combined dataset provides valuable insights into the adaptive responses of wheat accessions to changing climates.Hybrid Prompt### Investigation Description:  This dataset comprises records collected during the seed regeneration routine of the wheat collection hosted at the Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research (IPK)### Top-Level-Metadata:  | Meta Data | Description || --------- | ----------- || Submission Date | 2019-03-19T15:04 || Public Release Date | 2019-07-29T12:00 || Study identifiers | s_winter_wheat , s_spring_wheat , s_weather || Study Count | 3 || Assay identifiers | a_spring_wheat , a_winter_wheat , a_weather || Assay Count | 3 | ## Study_s_winter_wheat_GrowthCharacteristics: (Organism: Triticum aestivum ; Material source ID (Holding institute/stock centre, accession): TRI 10 ...

This effort supports the long-term conservation and agronomic evaluation of winter and spring wheat germplasm within the IPK Genebank, while integrating historical weather data to evaluate environmental influences on wheat development.The experimental design compares growth and phenotypic traits of over 70,000 wheat samples across two major seasonal growth habitsÑwinter and springÑbased on sowing date as the central treatment factor. Accessions were cultivated from various countries between 1945 and 1981, with each accession annotated by taxonomic identity, geographic origin, and passport metadata. The *s\_winter\_wheat* and *s\_spring\_wheat* studies provided input to assays focused on harvesting, phenotyping, and seed regeneration, allowing for cross-evaluation of growth behavior across different temporal and climatic regimes. Environmental context was provided through a dedicated weather study recording monthly temperature and precipitation metrics since 1953 at the Gatersleben IPK site, enabling correlative analysis with plant performance. Historical meteorological data were collected initially through manual methods and later via automated systems, with certain data gaps acknowledged. The integration of phenotypic and environmental data into downstream assays supports the reconstruction of genotype-by-environment interactions critical for germplasm maintenance and breeding applications.Enhanced PromptSummarize the biological and experimental objectives of the following Investigation based on the available metadata of its Studies and Assays.        You will receive identifiers, ontology annotations, and descriptive metadata for each component.        Extract relevant experimental factors and variables to construct a structured summary in two paragraphs:        - **Paragraph 1 (2-3 sentences):** Summarize the experimental objective of the Investigation        - **Paragraph 2 (5-7 sentences):** Describe the experimental design and methodology        Employ formal scientific language appropriate for an abstract and methods section.### Investigation Description:  This dataset comprises records collected during the seed regeneration routine of the wheat collection hosted at the Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research (IPK)### Top-Level-Metadata:  | Meta Data | Description || --------- | ----------- || Submission Date | 2019-03-19T15:04 || Public Release Date | 2019-07-29T12:00 || Study identifiers | s_winter_wheat , s_spring_wheat , s_weather || Study Count | 3 || Assay identifiers | a_spring_wheat , a_winter_wheat , a_weather || Assay Count | 3 | ## Study_s_winter_wheat_GrowthCharacteristics: (Organism: Triticum aestivum ; Material source ID (Holding institute/stock centre, accession): TRI 10 ...

This effort contributes to the long-term conservation and documentation of genetic diversity within the extensive IPK wheat collection, which includes over 27,000 globally sourced accessions, emphasizing both winter and spring growth habits.To achieve this, the study was divided into three components: growth studies for winter and spring wheat, and a long-term weather monitoring program. Over 32,000 winter and 40,000 spring wheat accessions were grown at different sowing dates (ranging from 1945 to 1981), reflecting broad temporal and genetic diversity. Seed regeneration procedures, along with phenotypic and harvest assessments, were conducted via linked assays that recorded variables such as year, sowing date, and accession metadata. Concurrently, a dedicated meteorological study documented monthly weather variablesÑincluding temperature, precipitation, and humidityÑat the IPK campus from 1953 to 2015. These environmental data were integrated into the analysis to contextualize plant performance across seasons and years. The assays followed a structured design linking growth, phenotyping, and seed regeneration, ensuring traceability of accessions and enabling quality-controlled seed renewal under historical and contemporary conditions.
